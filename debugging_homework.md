Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

The purpose of a breakpoint is to stop the code running at a certain line of your code and launch the debugger console, so that you can assess the problems up to said breakpoint.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No, it will only run up until the line of code before your breakpoint

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

We use the Step Over command to debug the next line of code.

4. What does the step into command do?

The step into command will let you see whats happening within the line of code that your breakpoint is set to by redirecting you to it's method.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression will let you evaluate and call methods on Classes that you've made, and Evalute code fragment will let you run multiple lines of code, and will let you assign classes to new variables.
